## Functionalities

- SimpleDraw is based on the notion of documents;
- Documents are rendered either in SVG or HTMLCanvas;
- Multiple views of the same model;
- Two interaction modes: point-n-click and REPLs;
- Support persistence in multiple formats (TXT, XML, BIN);
- Extendible with different objects (triangles, arrows, ...);
- Extendible with new tools (rotate, translate, grid, ...);
- Support (un)limited Undo / Redo of all operations;
- Eventually extra funcionalities to be decided later.
